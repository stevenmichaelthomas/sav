  question:
    content: >
      When someone says a person was "playing hard to get," they usually mean that
      the person was pretending not to be interested in someone romantically (or
      sexually) when they really were. It's totally fine say this in public in
      Canada.
    options:
      - Yup!
      - It's socially acceptable, but it shouldn't be.
      - Women think it is, but men generally don't.
      - No way!
  answer:

    content: |
      This is generally something that men say about women, and tends to be more
      socially accepted among men than women, though this is slowly changing.
      Girls (in particular) will be described as “playing hard to get,” when
      really they are not interested. This idea that people pretend not to like
      someone in order to encourage sexual advances from the other person is
      very prevalent in rape culture. If someone says they are not interested,
      respond respectfully, and walk away. If, in the very off chance that they
      were pretending not to be interested, they can approach you afterwards.

      By making this sign with his hand, is this man sending a romantic or sexual message?
    options:
      - Heck yes!
      - Not with his hand gesture... but maybe his facial expression.
      - No way - this is totally insulting!
  answer:
    key: 1
    content: |
      In Canada, his action may be interpreted as him flirting because of his
      facial expression, but the gesture itself is not flirty. Important: in
      some countries this is a VERY rude gesture (equivalent to the Canadian
      gesture of raising your middle finger with the back of your hand facing
      a person, which means “f*ck you”); however, in Canada, this gesture is
      seen to be the same as a peace sign, or simply meaning the number 2.

  question:
    content: >
      On dates, it's pretty common for Canadian couples to "go Dutch." What the
      heck does that mean?
    options:
      - Each person pays half of the bill.
      - The person who earns more money pays the bill.
      - The person who made the invitation pays the bill.
      - The woman pays the bill.
      - The couple runs away without paying the bill.

  answer:
    key: 0
    content: |
      It's pretty common for Canadian couples to split the bill evenly when out on a date. Similarly, when out with friends, each person usually pays for their own meal, or, if all the meals were a similar price, the group may "go Dutch," and split the bill evenly. In other countries, this practice is called: to pay the way Catalans do (Spain) to pay like they do in Rome (Italy) to pay the bill the German way (Turkey) His, His; Whose, Whose (Bangladesh) American share (Thailand) American style (Columbia). Regardless of who pays, there is no obligation or expectation to have sex, or even kiss your date. It is always your choice what happens to your body.

      True or false: It's totally ok to call someone a slut if they are known to
      date lots of people.
    options:
      - True - it's common slang.
      - False - it's totally insulting.
      - Depends if you know them or not.

  answer:
    key: 1
    content: |
      Absolutely false. It is totally insulting call someone a slut, and implies a negative judgement about that person's character. You may, nevertheless, hear people say it, and even claim that it's a joke, or no big deal. However, this word can really hurt people. It's a slanderous word that is more often directed at women, while men are more likely to be called a "player" - a word that doesn't have quite the same negative connotations and reputation damaging potential as "slut" does. It's really an awful thing to say. Plus, who are you to judge what is right for another person?

  question:
    content: >
      If your Canadian friend says: "My date stood me up!" What do they mean?
    options:
      - Their date pulled out their chair for them to sit down on. How chivalrous!
      - Their date did not show up. Meanie pants!
      - At the end of the date, they stood awkwardly at the door while one of them tried to kiss the other, but the other kept pushing them away.

  answer:
    key: 1
    content: |
      When someone says they've been "stood up," it means the person they were supposed to go out with didn't show up for their date, and didn't contact them to say they wouldn't be there. It's rude and unkind. In other countries, there are different expressions associated with this practice, including "placing a rabbit" (France), "giving pit" (Italy), "dynamite" (Russia), "bouncing" (China), and simply "betraying" (Iceland). For the record, the answer for C is sexual harassment. Don't do that!

  question:
    content: >
      If someone asks if you want to hook up, what are they asking you to do?
    options:
      - Call them on the phone to make a date or get to know each other better.
      - Go out on a date with them.
      - Meet up to have sex.

  answer:
    key: 2
    content: |
      The term "hooking up" has a definite implication of a sexual encounter, often between people who are not in a serious relationship. If someone asks you to hook up, it is an invitation, and you don't have to say yes if you don't want to, even if it sounds sort of like a command (ex. "come over to my place tonight so we can hook up"). It is an ambiguous phrase, and can also mean making out (kissing), as explained at: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/12/hooking-up_n_1007364.html. Because of this, if you’re unsure what exactly is on the table, but you’re interested in finding out, then clarify with the person what they mean.

      - Do everything this guy says. He's a genius!

      This is not terrible advice - it's very good to remember a couple of things that the speaker glossed over, though: 1. If a girl isn't looking at you, touching you, or talking to you, it's probably not a good idea to interrupt her. 2. He is giving tips for when to TALK to a girl. This does not mean you should feel entitled to touch her in any way, and if she doesn't seem like she wants to talk to you after all, then you need to leave her alone, otherwise, it is harassment.

      True or false: In Canada, if you are LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans* [including transsexual, transgender, non-gender etc], queer, etc), you better hide it from your boss, or it's pretty likely you'll be fired on the spot.

    options:

      Whether you harass someone in person or online, it’s still harassment, it goes against school policies (posted below). If you are threatening someone’s safety, it is against the law, and you can be charged with criminal harassment or uttering threats.

      Calling someone a pansy...
    options:
      - Is a lovely compliment. Pansies are beautiful!
      - Is a rude way of telling a woman that you think she is nice looking.
      - Is intended to be an insult.
  answer:
    key: 2
    content: |
      Calling someone a pansy is meant to be an insult, generally directed at men. Like many insults often directed at men, calling someone a pansy implies that they are feminine, and therefore less of a man. It can also imply that the man is homosexual. Not only is it totally inappropriate to harass another person in this way, using things associated with women as insults can be very damaging to girls’ self-esteem, and there are many initiatives, such as the #likeagirl campaign, that are working to change this negative North American habit.

      True or False: If a man wears pink, it means that he is gay.
    options:
      - Yes, it’s a pretty clear sign.
      - No. If a man is wearing pink, it means he wants to wear pink. It’s not a statement about who he’s attracted to!
  answer:
    key: 1
    content: |
      In North America, and much of the west, pink is a colour that is often associated with girls. Therefore, some people may assume that if a boy wants to wear that colour, then he is gay. In fact, pink used to be a colour that was associated with boys, not girls, and it’s only relatively recently that large department stores changed that norm. The only way to know if a man is gay is if he tells you he is. Even if you see him engage in public displays of affection with another man, you don’t know the whole story. He may come from another culture where, for example, holding hands with another man is the norm, or kissing hello is common practice. Or perhaps he is bisexual (attracted to both males and females), or transsexual (attracted to people of all genders). You just can’t “tell” who another person is attracted to by the clothes they wear.

      If someone says they’re bisexual, does that mean they’re more likely to cheat on you?
    options:
      - Of course not. Just because someone likes people of whatever gender, it doesn’t mean they like ALL those people. And besides, being attracted to someone is not the same as being deceitful to your partner. To cheat on your partner is abusing their trust.
      - Yes! If someone is bisexual, that means they are attracted to guys AND girls, so they’re super sexual people.

      Bisexuality just means that an individual is attracted to people of more than one gender. This doesn’t exclude those people from identifying as gay or heterosexual, and in fact, people who identify as bisexual are sometimes excluded from both of those communities of support, due to stigmas and misinformation. People who identify as bisexual are no more sexual, as a group, than any other group who identifies with a certain sexuality. A person is a person, and you have to decide for yourself if an individual is trustworthy or not. Don’t decide based on their sexuality, but on their personal character.

  question:
    content: >
      Ok... but in English, talking about someone’s sex and their gender is the same thing. Right?
    options:
      - Yup. Those words are interchangeable, especially in biology class.
      - They are similar, but not the same. Someone’s sex is their X and Y chromosomes, while gender is if they are male or female.
      - Nope. They’re thought to be the same (or at least close enough), but that totally ignores all the other kinds of gender that exist other than male and female.
  answer:
    key: 2
    content: |
      Sex is indeed the chromosomal makeup of a person – do they have XX chromosomes, or XY chromosomes, or XXY chromosomes (a less common, but still present occurrence). Gender is actually a spectrum, so diminishing it to two genders (male and female) ignores the reality of an entire part of the population.

  question:
    content: >
      Ok... so what the heck are gender identity and gender roles then?
    options:
      - Gender identity is a person’s deep psychological feeling of connection or affinity with a certain gender. Their gender role is how they show their gender to the outside world.
      - A person’s gender identity the label given to them by the doctor or midwife when they are born. Their gender role is how they act in public as they grow up.
      - Gender identity is the label that is on a person’s government issued identification cards. Their gender role is the role they play in public.
  answer:
    key: 0
    content: |
      According to the Medscape, an online medical journal and web resource for medical professionals, gender identity is personally identified, and it may or may not be the same as the sex that is assigned to a person at birth, and listed on government identification cards. A person’s gender role is an outward expression of gender through clothing, mannerisms and behaviour. It is usually the same gender as the one they identify with, but not always. Culture also plays a role in these two definitions. You can read more here: http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/917990-overview.

      What should you do if you see a person you believe is transgender (a person who was born a man, but lives as a woman) going into the women's bathroom at school?
    options:
      - Nothing! People can choose which bathroom to use.

    content: |
      We’re back to a question about human rights, and the answer to this question is, without a doubt, A. A transgender person living as a woman identifies with that gender, so it is completely appropriate for her to use the women's bathroom. It’s important to note that transgender men and women can feel that THEY are the people whose safety is at risk in this situation.

      Read more about what it feels like from the point of view of a transgender person picking which bathroom to use: http://iamtransgendered.com/RestRooms.aspx

      Please note: if you feel that your safety is at risk, go to a safe place, and then call security. However, you should not assume a transgender person is dangerous merely because s/he may look different from you, and confronting that person about their choice of bathroom is completely inappropriate and offensive.

      Pronouns can be tricky. What do you call a person who is currently in transition from identifying with one gender to identifying with another (ex. An individual who was born with female biological attributes, but is transitioning to identifying as a man).
    options:
      - She was born a girl, so you call her “she.”
      - He is living as a man, so you call him “him.”
      - He/she is confused, and so am I! Call the person “him/her.”
      - Is this going back to that third gender question? Should I call the person “it?”
  answer:
    key: 1
    content: |
      It’s not always the case, but usually, the best practice is to call the person by the pronoun associated with the gender they are transitioning towards. Take a cue from the person’s introduction. If they introduce themselves with a traditionally male name, then use the male pronoun to refer to them. Likewise if they use a traditionally female name. If you’re not sure, you really need to know (ex. You’ll be interacting with this person on a team, so you’ll be referring to them often), and you feel comfortable doing so, you can ask in a respectful way.

      True or false: traditional definitions of what it means to be a man are a barrier for ambitious women in the workplace.
    options:
      - What? That’s crazy talk. It’s just because women take time off more than men that they lag behind in wage and level of seniority.
      - True story! If the man is “supposed” to be the bread-winner/leader/boss, where does that leave the woman? In subordinate positions, that’s where!
  answer:
    key: 1
    content: |
      Traditional expectations of men’s behaviours and values have shaped corporate culture, meaning that women’s strengths are sometimes overlooked. In fact, some studies show that women with children are seen to be the least desirable candidates by human resources professionals (due to a presumed lack of commitment to the company), while men with children are the most desirable candidates (due to presumed attributes of responsibility and reliability). Men and women with no kids rank somewhere in the middle; however, women, regardless of their family composition, had lower wages than their male colleagues.
