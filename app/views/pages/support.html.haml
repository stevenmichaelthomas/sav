        Are you someone who likes to engage in conversations, learn new things
        and support their fellow peers? Then may we suggest becoming a part of
        the new Peer Support Team at Royal Roads!

        RRUSA and SAV are looking for highly motivated, on-campus, second year
        students who are interested in joining us as Peer Support Volunteers for
        a seven month pilot project.

      %p.heading-4
        Training will commence in the fall, but we are looking for applications
        now. Check out our #{link_to 'position description', @description_url}
        for more details and if you like what you see, send us your application.
        We will be hosting an info night in September, but if you have any
        questions in the meantime, feel free to pop us an email.
