      DEFINITELY go back and re-read all of the correct answers. Your life on campus will be WAY
      more awesome once you understand how to respectfully engage with your fellow students."

      of the articles on the next page. Probably a good idea to check out what the real answers were for
      all those questions you got wrong. It’s time to open those eyes, friend!! Bring on the respect."

      "Not bad! Still a good idea to check out at least some of the articles on the next
      page, and see what the real answers were for the questions you got wrong. Still, you did well.
      Rock on."

      "YES. Awesome work, friend. This is what we want to see. Talk to your friends, and spread all
      the good information you’ve got tucked away in your brain. We need more people like you on
      campus! You might be interested in the articles on the next page – there’s always room to learn
      more – but, friend: I’m proud of you."
